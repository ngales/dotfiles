# .inputrc
# Readline initialization file
# Unless otherwise specified by setting a shell variable INPUTRC to the file, the location of this file should be "~/.inputrc".

# If on Cygwin, the latest version as installed by the Cygwin Setup program can
# always be found at "/etc/defaults/etc/skel/.inputrc". Modifying /etc/skel/.inputrc directly will prevent
# setup from updating it.

# Since these are variables, you could instead add them to a different dotfile, but you wouldn't have them in non-bash applications using readline, such as the python interpreter.  Thus, it is best to keep them here.

# To reload changes within a terminal without relauching, do "bind -f <.inputrc location", e.g. "bind -f ~./inputrc".  Alternatively, just restart bash with "exec bash".  Alternatively, if .aliases has been loaded, simply typing "reload" should do the trick.
